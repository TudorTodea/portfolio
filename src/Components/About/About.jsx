        I specialize in building full-stack applications with ReactJS and Node JS.
        Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task.
        Although I am most proficient in building  applications using Javascript,React, NodeJS,MongoDB,Bootstrap and Material-UI,
        I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed.
        I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.</p>
            <br/>
        <p>I graduated from university in 2022 with a Computer Science Degree, I have 5 months work experience as a fullstack developer working with tools like React and Node JS .
            I am currently looking for work as a frontend/backend or fullstack developer </p>
